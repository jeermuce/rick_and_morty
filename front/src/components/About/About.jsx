            I'm a aspiring software engineer, currently learning Web Development
            Full Stack at soyHenry, and enrolled in a Software Engineering
            degree at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Chihuahua.
          </p>
          <p>
            This website is a project assigned as a way to integrate all the
            knowledge we've acquired during the course. In the Front End stage
            of the bootcamp, I used React, Redux, and CSS modules to access an
            API available at https://rickandmortyapi.com/ and display
            information about the characters of the show Rick and Morty. I will
            soon be constructing a Back End to this project as I advance in the
            course.
          </p>
          <p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
